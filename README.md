## Dependencies

SSMSQoL - https://github.com/razuhl/SSMSQoL

## Features

* Weapons can be stored in player or abandoned colonies simply by docking. By setting a threshold excess weapons won't be stored so they can be sold knowing there are enough in reserve. The threshold can be deactivated for weapons for which the blueprint is not known.
* Items that need to be kept from pirates and raiders can be stored as well. For example all recipes so pirates cannot learn them.
* By defining a demand/limit for an item and setting lowest sell and highest buy price the fleet will load and offload items on the open market, military market or, if the transponder is off, on the blackmarket. Simply set a demand for desired weapons to scan the markets you visit, restock supplies, fuel and personel or offload looted metals.

The mod uses the game menu(F10 by default) from SSMSQoL to allow configuring the features while in game. The settings are stored in the savegame.

## FAQ

Can this be added to and removed from an ongoing save? It can be added but must be uninstalled from a save via an option in the game menu.
